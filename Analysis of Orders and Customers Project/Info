Analysis of Orders and Customers Project

Part I – SQL/Data Handling
Query #1
We want to focus on Breakfast cuisine in smaller cities of Greece.
For every city that exceeds the 1,000 orders we would like to compare "Breakfast" cuisine versus the
total, creating the metrics:
- Basket := Amount / Order
- Frequency := Orders / Users
- %Users that exceed 3 orders := (Users of Frequency >3) / Users

Query #2
What percentage of Orders do the top 10 users of each city contribute to their city?

Part II - Analyze Users
- We need to segment existing customers based on their frequency and order value.
- Ordering Breakfast is a quite new habit that Marketing thinks could create more loyal
customers. Which segment could be a valuable target group for a Marketing campaign about
“Breakfast” cuisine_parent?

Use the provided csv, create user segments, answer the business
question, and prepare a presentation to share your findings/insights with the BI team.
